This repository contains my solutions and investigations for the blockchain security challenges proposed by the game [Capture the Ether](https://capturetheether.com/challenges/).

The challenges are divided into 4 main groups:

1. [Lotteries](https://github.com/JMariadlcs/capture-the-ether-solved/tree/main/Lotteries).
2. [Math](https://github.com/JMariadlcs/capture-the-ether-solved/tree/main/Math).
3. [Accounts](https://github.com/JMariadlcs/capture-the-ether-solved/tree/main/Accounts).
4. [Miscellaneous](https://github.com/JMariadlcs/capture-the-ether-solved/tree/main/Miscellaneous).

Some useful resources that I have used to understand some of the challenges are:

1. [Cmichel solutions](https://cmichel.io/capture-the-ether-solutions/).
2. [Dac solutions](https://dac.ac/blog/capture_the_ether_solutions/#solution-11).
